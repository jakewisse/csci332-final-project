Final Project for CSCI 332 - Databases
======================================

This is my final project for CSCI 332 at the College of Charleston.  It is a web application for a [sort of] imaginary eco-tours business called the Charleston Paddler.  Here's a living list of functional requirements for this app:

+ Allow customers to create an account, using their email address as a password.
+ Allow customers to make a reservation for a tour, selecting a currently open time slot.
+ Allow admins to login at a separate page, where they can view:
	+ Customers' account information
	+ Reservation information by day, reservation number, customer's name, or time. (This should satisfy the reporting requirement).
